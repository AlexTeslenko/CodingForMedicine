## 1. Coding a medical calculator
This Jupyter Notebook and .py file contain a simple medical calculator for calculating a patient's score of SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Repsonse Syndrome).

An accompanying blog post is available [here](https://www.codemd.co.uk/sirs-calculator/) and a YouTube tutorial for writing this code is available here.

All credit to [Harvinder Power](https://github.com/harvinder-power) for designing this exericse.



## 2. Predicting hospital non-attendance
(Predicting_No_Shows.ipynb)

Training a neural network to predict who will and won't attend hospital appointments.

Uses the **"Medical Appointment No Shows" Kaggle dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/downloads/noshowappointments.zip/5)) and **scikit-learn** (documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

Designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but can be run elsewhere.

Accompanying blog post describing the exercise in detail available [here](https://chrislovejoy.me/no-shows/).



## 3. Diagnosing breast cancer
(Breast_cancer_features.ipynb)

An introductory exercise initially designed for 'Machine Learning for Healthcare' courses ([MLmedics.com/](https://MLmedics.com/)).

Uses the **'Breast Cancer Wisconsin' Kaggle dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/downloads/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.zip/2)) and **scikit-learn** (documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

Designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
