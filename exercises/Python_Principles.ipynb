    "#### Data Type Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are one way to modify data, but Python also provides some functionality specific to each data type, we call these methods. **Methods** are functions that are contained within an object. This is not essential knowledge but perhaps worth saying something about.  It is in the combination of operators and methods we can control what data becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned before that all data types in Python are objects, think of the methods as being part of those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't covered functions in detail yet, but with built-in methods, some of them require passing some data to the method in order to get the intended outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand methods we should define some terms. To pass this information to a method, we assign values to a **parameter** of the method. The assigned values are called **arguments**. The act of using a method on a data type is called a **method invocation** or calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to insert a list item into a list. We need to specify what the list item is and where in the list to put it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list `insert()` method has two required parameters `pos` and `element`. The syntax looks like this `list.insert(pos,elmnt)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "So valid syntax for this method might be `list.insert(1,\"Data Science\")`. The arguments are `1` and `Data Science`. Here we are assigning the parameter `pos` with the value `1` and assigning the parameter `elmnt` with `Data Science`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When learning about methods, it's useful to have a structure of  type of information to know about when using these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each method, we should be able to recall the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The description\n",
    "2. The syntax of the method (can we pass any values to the method)\n",
    "3. The return value of the method\n",
    "4. Are there any peculiarities about the method (does it return something you don't expect ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this takes time, programming is a process, and the act of doing programming clarifies this information more than basic recall. "
