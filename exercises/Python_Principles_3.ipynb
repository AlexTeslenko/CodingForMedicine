A function in Python performs a tasks. Knowing what objects are at this stage is not essential knowledge, but understanding generally what a method will help.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In order to understand methods we should define some terms. To pass this information to a method python gives us defined variables called **parameters** we can assign values to. The assigned values are called **arguments**. The act of using a method on a data type is called a **method invocation** or calling a method. These terms will make sense in the example below.\n",
